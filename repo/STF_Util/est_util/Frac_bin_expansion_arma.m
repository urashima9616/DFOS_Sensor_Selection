% Bionomial expansion for Fractional order differencing operator to 
% generate the new time series Z
% Z(t)=(1-L)^d*X(t)
%
% Input arguments:
%
%   X          : the time series input
%
%   d          : the fractional order 
%
%   N          : the length of the expansion

% Output arguments: 
%
%   Z          : the new time series
